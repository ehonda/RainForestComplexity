# Samples

## Allowed complexity maximized

```console
r = 8, d = 8, m = 1
InnerLoop = 262,308,819 = 2.62E+008
OuterLoop = 17,139,600 = 1.71E+007
```

## Our test example

```console
r = 6, d = 6, m = 16
InnerLoop = 2,874,288 = 2.87E+006
OuterLoop = 41,209 = 4.12E+004
```

## Some interesting values

```console
r = 5, d = 5, m = 1
InnerLoop = 6,721 = 6.72E+003
OuterLoop = 2,704 = 2.70E+003
```

```console
r = 6, d = 6, m = 1
InnerLoop = 179,643 = 1.80E+005
OuterLoop = 41,209 = 4.12E+004
```

```console
r = 7, d = 6, m = 1
InnerLoop = 979,567 = 9.80E+005
OuterLoop = 178,031 = 1.78E+005
```

```console
r = 7, d = 7, m = 1
InnerLoop = 6,166,105 = 6.17E+006
OuterLoop = 769,129 = 7.69E+005
```

```console
r = 8, d = 7, m = 1
InnerLoop = 37,852,039 = 3.79E+007
OuterLoop = 3,630,780 = 3.63E+006
```

```console

```

```console

InnerLoop = 13,471,274,401 = 1.35E+010
OuterLoop = 447,195,609 = 4.47E+008
```

```console
r = 10, d = 10, m = 1
InnerLoop = 818,288,740,923 = 8.18E+011

## BigInteger fun ðŸ¥³

Here we see that inner loop already overflows at `r = 13, d = 13, m = 1`. Outer loop soon follows at
`r = 16, d = 16, m = 1`. We also look at some large results.

```console
r = 13, d = 13, m = 1
ulongMax = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 = 1.84E+019

OuterLoop = 764,214,897,046,969 = 7.64E+014
InnerLoop = 432,360,767,273,547,841 = 4.32E+017
